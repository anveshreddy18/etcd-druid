NOTE: We want to keep one thing constant throught the controller code : 
    1) Use Delete calls for unhealthy ( health is of etcd container in the first phase, it is of pod health in the second phase )
    2) Use Evict calls for perfectly healthy Etcd pod ( i.e both etcd and backup-restore containers are healthy)

The above is for consistency reasons, to not make the code more complex.

The update process of the OnDelete controller should be as follows : 

Delete all the pods with unhealthy `etcd` containers, wait for them to get ready, meanwhile if some other pod's etcd container becomes unhealthy, delete that pod also. 

----- ONCE ALL THE PODS HAVE HEALTHY ETCD CONTAINERS, we proceed to following step ------------


At this point, we have healthy etcd containers, the backup-restore containers can be healthy or unhealthy.

Then we need to update one pod at a time. 
[Needs discussion with team] The way to select the pod to be updated, is basically by checking the health of the backup-restore
container and the role of the etcd container. 

Now, how do we determine the `backup-restore` health? We simply use the `pod` health which if `backup-restore` is unhealthy will be set to false.
So we order the pods based on health + role. We assign more priority to health and then role. 

So the order of preference to delete will be: 

unhealthy pod + Member 
unhealthy pod + Leader 
healthy pod + Member 
healthy pod + Leader


Note: we don't consider `Learner` state here because if the `etcd` container is healthy till this point, then the etcd wont be in a learner state.

**IMPORTANT::**

These scenarios need to be reflected in the #Scenarios section of the proposal.
